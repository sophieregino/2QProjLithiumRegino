                    On March 19, 2020, the AAPI Equity Alliance (AAPI Equity), Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA), and the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State University launched the Stop AAPI Hate coalition in response to the alarming rise in xenophobia and bigotry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hate, violence, harassment, discrimination, shunning, and child bullying against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States are tracked and responded to by the coalition.

                    Their strategy emphasizes that in order to effectively combat anti-Asian racism, they must also struggle to eliminate all types of structural racism directed at Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color.

                    #BlackLivesMatter was formed in 2013 in response to Trayvon Martin's murderer's acquittal. Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. is a global organization with offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Its mission is to end white supremacy and create local power to intervene in state and vigilante violence against Black communities. They are winning immediate changes in their lives by resisting and countering acts of violence, providing space for Black ingenuity and innovation, and focusing on Black joy.
