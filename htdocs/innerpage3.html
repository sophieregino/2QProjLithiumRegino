                    The death of George Floyd during the COVID-19 outbreak drew worldwide attention to police brutality and structural racism in the United States. Despite social distancing advice, mask-wearing Black Lives Matter protesters flooded the streets around the world during the "Racial Reckoning Summer of 2020." From late May to the end of June 2020, roughly 20 million people in the United States participated in demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor, another Black body, among many others, who were perceived to be discriminatorily targeted and killed by police.

                    Following the murder of George Floyd, many people began to consider systematic racism to be a public health concern. There was a valid explanation for this. In the United States, structural racism also strengthens and informs policies that perpetuate racial disparities in health outcomes, inequalities in health determinants such as housing, education, and healthcare, and discriminatory policing of African Americans. In addition to the deaths caused by police aggression, research has shown that this form of violence causes bad health outcomes such as psychological stress, which can lead to stroke or premature aging.

                <h1>Racism in Asia</h1>
                <img src="../images/racism asia.jpeg" alt="" />
                <p>
                    COVID-19's global outbreak accentuated a slew of inequalities that predated the pandemic. There has been an alarming rise in xenophobic backlash, racial harassment, and violence towards Asians worldwide in recent months, with many blaming China and the Chinese for the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The first media accounts of COVID-19's racial impact were from restaurants and small business owners in Chinatowns and other Asian enclaves, whose enterprises had been severely harmed by xenophobic dread.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from the pandemic-related discrimination, another stereotype that leads to anti-Asian bias and hatred is the "model minority" myth, which holds that Asian Americans are uniquely successful and well-adapted because they are quiet, submissive, and hardworking. According to Sherry Wang, PhD, an associate professor of counseling psychology at Santa Clara University, the stereotype was created during the civil rights struggle to weaponize Asian Americans against Black Americans, and it hides the richness of the AAPI experience.
                    “It can also create the perception that Asian Americans are not considered to be people of color and that we are immune to racism,” Wang said. “Therefore, when people do speak up about it, our experiences are actually dismissed.”
